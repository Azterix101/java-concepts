Okay, here are a few common ways to reverse a string in Java, along with explanations.

**Method 1: Using `StringBuilder` (Recommended)**

This is generally the most concise and efficient method for reversing a string in Java. `StringBuilder` is mutable, making character manipulation faster than using immutable `String` objects repeatedly.

**Method 2: Manual Iteration with `StringBuilder`**

This method achieves the same result as Method 1 but explicitly shows the logic of iterating backward through the original string and appending characters.


**Method 3: Using a Character Array**

This approach involves converting the string to a character array, creating a new array, and filling it in reverse order.


**Method 4: In-Place Character Array Swap (Less common for returning a *new* string)**

This method modifies the character array directly. Note that `String` is immutable, so you still need to create a new `String` from the modified array if you want to return a standard `String` result.

**Which method to choose?**

*   For general use, **Method 1 (`StringBuilder.reverse()`)** is the most recommended due to its simplicity, readability, and likely performance optimization within the Java library.
*   Method 2 (Manual `StringBuilder`) is good for understanding the underlying process.
*   Methods 3 and 4 (Character Arrays) are also valid and demonstrate different ways to manipulate the characters. The in-place swap (Method 4) is more memory-efficient if you only need the character array, but since you usually need a `String` result, the benefit is slightly reduced by the final `new String(chars)` creation.
